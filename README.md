__The Sky Fighters__

I have been working on this game for a few months in my spare time for fun. 
Initially, it was a traditional vertically scrolling game but I wanted to
take on the challenge of something more 2-dimensional that would allow me 
to really test concepts like pathfinding for enemy AI, which would allow 
for more interesting enemies. Some more features I'd like to add are
multiple player support, controller support, and eventually, a mobile
version for Android or iOs.
